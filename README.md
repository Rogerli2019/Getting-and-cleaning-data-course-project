# Getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project
This is the repository for the getting and cleaning course on cousera.

The repository contains five documents. The first one is this README file, which explains the general information within this repository. The second file, the Codebook file, explains the information on the dataset and the correspoding transformation from raw data to the final tidy data files. The resulting tidy data files are two txt files finished according to the cousera requirement. The last file, Data_cleaning, is the detailed R code used to manipulate data.

Thank you and have fun using this repository!
